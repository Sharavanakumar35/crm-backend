# CRM JobConnect Backend

Welcome to the CRM JobConnect Backend! This backend server is the brain behind our job portal application, CRM JobConnect. Let's take a look at how it works:

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**: When you visit our job portal website and sign up or log in, this backend server verifies your identity to ensure you're a legitimate user. It does this by checking your username and password against our database of registered users.

2. **Token-Based Authentication**: Once your identity is confirmed, the server generates a special token for you. Think of this token as a digital pass that allows you to access different parts of our website without having to log in repeatedly. This token is securely stored in your browser's cookies.

3. **Managing User Profiles**: You can view and edit your profile details on our website. Behind the scenes, this backend server handles all the information about your profile, such as your username, email, and profile picture. It ensures that only you can access and modify your profile information.

4. **Managing Job Applicants**: Our job portal allows you to create, edit, and delete job applicants. This backend server stores all the details about these job applicants, such as their name, email, company, and position. It also keeps track of their status (whether the job is open, closed, or pending) and type (full-time, part-time, etc.).

5. **Sending Emails**: Both users and admins can send emails to job applicants directly from our website. This backend server handles the email sending process, making sure that your messages reach the right recipients. Whether you're a user or an admin, you can communicate with job applicants seamlessly through our platform.

6. **Admin Privileges**: If you're an admin user, you have additional privileges, such as the ability to delete job applicants and assign them to other users or admins. This backend server ensures that only admins can perform these actions, keeping our job portal secure and organized.

7. **Security**: Security is a top priority for us. This backend server uses industry-standard encryption techniques to protect your data and ensure that your interactions with our website are safe and secure.


That's a high-level overview of how our CRM JobConnect Backend works. It's the engine that powers our job portal application and makes it possible for users like you to find and manage job applicants with ease. If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to us!
